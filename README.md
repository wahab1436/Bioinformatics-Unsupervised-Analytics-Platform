# Bioinformatics-Unsupervised-Analytics-Platform (Streamlit)

A **production-grade Streamlit app** for gene expression analysis. Upload your datasets (CSV/TSV/XLSX), automatically preprocess, perform **K-Means clustering**, PCA/UMAP visualization, anomaly detection, generate AI-driven insights, and securely export or delete results.

## Project Overview

This platform is designed for **high-dimensional gene expression datasets**. It provides a complete, adaptive workflow for **unsupervised ML in bioinformatics**, including:

- **Dynamic data upload** with schema detection  
- **Adaptive preprocessing**: missing value imputation, scaling, encoding, duplicate removal  
- **Unsupervised ML**: K-Means clustering (auto-k), optional DBSCAN, PCA/UMAP embeddings  
- **Anomaly detection**: Isolation Forest to flag unusual samples  
- **AI-driven insights**: cluster summaries, marker genes, pathway enrichment, clinical correlations  
- **Interactive visualizations**: 2D/3D scatter plots, heatmaps, boxplots, Kaplan–Meier plots  
- **Secure exports**: download cleaned data, clusters, features, insights  
- **One-click deletion**: removes all uploaded files and session artifacts  
- **Error-proof execution**: handles messy datasets without crashes  

This project demonstrates **enterprise-grade unsupervised ML + interactive dashboards + AI insight generation** and is ideal for bioinformatics research, internships, or portfolio showcase.
